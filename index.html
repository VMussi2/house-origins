        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are House Origins, a collective of three passionate DJs and music producers from Argentina—Valentin Mussi aka MÜSSI, Cristian Rodriguez aka Cristofer, and Agustin Agosto aka A. Agosto. Our journey began when we re-encountered each other in college in the United States, united by a shared love for the vibrant beats of House music.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the legendary scenes in Chicago and New York, we embarked on a musical quest to create and play House music that resonates with the soul. Each mix we produce is a reflection of our unique style and the energy we've experienced in these iconic cities. Now, we're taking our beats to the stages of Miami, New York, and Chicago, sharing our passion with every note.</p>
